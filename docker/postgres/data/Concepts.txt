Generative processes are those that most of us think about when we think of creativity. They are the processes by which creative concepts are first born. These processes are highly visible in extreme acts of creativity, but they are also evident in ordinary, everyday cognition.  Examples (from Ward et al.(cited below)) include memory retrieval, association formation among information retrieved from memory, combinations of structures retrieved from memory, the synthesis of new structures, the transformation of retrieved structures into "new forms," analogical transfer between domains, and "categorical reduction," which involves reducing existing structures to "more primitive constituents". Exploratory processes are the processes used to explore the structures produced by generative processes. Examples of exploratory processes (given by Ward, et al.) include searching retrieved structures for "novel attributes," searching for "metaphorical implications," searching for possible functions, "the evaluation of structures from different perspectives or within different contexts," interpretation of structures from the perspective of the problem(s) to be solved, and "the search for various practical or conceptual limitations that are suggested by the structures."]]>	trm_4a3fd79d09f2a

Based on feedback from customers, we are introducing four new subtests and modifying three existing subtests. 4 subtests were added: * Spatial Addition, * Symbol Span, * Design Memory, * General Cognitive Screener. 3 subtests retained with modifications: * Logical Memory, Although the stories remain the same as seen in WMS-III for ages 16-69 years old, the repetition trial for Story B has been dropped to increase the consistency with previous editions. For the older age range of 65-90 years old, a new story was developed with content more relevant. The story is shorter and repeated once to enable adequate floor through age 90. You can obtain immediate versus delay and recognition versus delay contrast scores. * Verbal Paired Associates, It now includes a combination of difficult and easy items. For the younger age group (16-69 years) there are 14 items of which 10 are hard. For the older age group (65-90 years), there are 10 items of which six are hard. Delayed Free Recall Trial has been added while Recognition Trial has increased its level of difficulty. You can obtain immediate versus delay and recognition versus delay contrast scores. * Visual Reproduction, While following the same structure and format as seen in WMS-III, there have been a few changes to the subtest. Recognition Trial has been shortened and scoring has been improved. Based on Munro Cullum’s research, scoring is easier and faster than previously experienced and emphasizes recall with less focus on drawing accuracy. You can obtain immediate versus delay and recognition versus delay contrast scores. 8 subtests were eliminated:* Information & Orientation, * Spatial Span, * Mental Control, * Faces, * Digit Span, * Family Pictures, * Letter Number, * Word List (CVLT-II can be entered int]]>	trm_4b94b12bf0eb2

769	<![CDATA[Corsi Blocks]]>	task	<![CDATA[Was developed in the early 1970s as a visuospatial counterpart to the verbal-memory span task (Milner, 1971). Over the years, it has frequently been used to assess visuospatial short-term memory performance in adults (e.g. Smyth & Scholey, 1992), children (e.g. Orsini, Schiappa, & Grossi, 1981), and patients with neuropsychological deficits (e.g. Vilkki & Holst, 1989). The original Corsi apparatus consisted of a set of nine identical blocks (3 X 3 X 3 cm) irregularly positioned on a wooden board (23 X 28 cm). The experimenter points to a series of blocks at a rate of one block per second. Subsequently, the participant is required to point to the same blocks in their order of presentation. The length of the block sequences increases until recall is no longer correct. Numerous variations have since been employed in both display characteristics (e.g. colour, number and size of the blocks, block placement, size of the board) and test administration (e.g. presentation rate, block sequences, recall order, scoring technique) (for a review, see Berch, Krikorian, & Huha, 1998).]]>	trm_4da881dace79c

SWM is a test of the participant’s ability to retain spatial information and to manipulate remembered items in working memory. It is a self-ordered task, which also assesses heuristic strategy. This test is a sensitive measure of frontal lobe and ‘executive’ dysfunction. It has been shown in recent studies that impaired performance on SWM emerges as a common factor in prepsychosis. The test begins with a number of coloured squares (boxes) being shown on the screen. The aim of this test is that, by touching the boxes and using a process of elimination, the participant should find one blue ‘token’ in each of a number of boxes and use them to fill up an empty column on the right hand side of the screen. The number of boxes is gradually increased, until it is necessary to search a total of eight boxes. The colour and position of the boxes used are changed from trial to trial to discourage the use of stereotyped search strategies.]]>	trm_4f2453b806fe1

The game was originally developed by cognitive psychologists at the University of Illinois, as a tool to study learning and training strategies. Notably, it is one of the few cognitive training tools that has shown transfer of training to real-world performance. Flight students that trained on Space Fortress performed better on a battery of real-world flight tests, and were more likely to be selected to pursue pilot training compared to a no-training control group. Studies have also found that learning Space Fortress with a strategy that involves flexibly shifting attention to different aspects of the game results in improved learning. Thus, the Space Fortress game serves as a great tool for studying how the brain acquires new, complex skills, and how the trained ability can extend to new contexts.

The gLMS is a measure of perceived intensity, with seven anchor labels provided (Strongest imaginable, Very strong, Strong, Moderate, Weak, Barely detectable, No sensation). Participants can rate their intensity by clicking with a computer mouse on any point on the scale from Strongest imaginable to No sensation. The computer records the exact location of the response. A score from 0-100 on a semi-logarithmic scale is produced for each of the four items (quinine whole mouth, salt whole mouth, quinine tip of tongue, salt tip of tongue), corresponding to the point on the gLMS where the participant clicked. A higher score represents greater perceived intensity of the tastant.]]>	trm_50f379c6c9ea9
961	<![CDATA[NIH Toolbox Visual Acuity Test]]>	task	<![CDATA[This test directly measures participants’ visual acuity or distance vision. The participant is seated 12.5 feet away from a computer monitor at eye level, and letters (called “optotypes”) are displayed one at a time on the screen for the participant to identify, using both eyes at the same time, with the participant wearing his/her normal corrective lenses for distance vision (glasses or contact lenses), if worn. As the participant successfully identifies optotypes of a given size, smaller ones appear on the screen, until the computer program ascertains the smallest-size optotype the participant can successfully see. Conversely, the program displays larger optotypes if the participant cannot see the size that is first displayed, until a size that he/she can accurately see is found. For participants ages 3-7, only the letters H, O, T and V are used, and children may point to a laminated card showing the letters if they cannot verbalize or recall the letter names. For participants ages 8 and above, the entire set of optotypes is used, following a common protocol used in professional vision testing. This is the standard binocular visual acuity measure scored in LogMAR units.]]>	trm_50f37caf81432

963	<![CDATA[NIH Toolbox Dynamic Visual Acuity Test]]>	task	<![CDATA[This test is a measure of gaze stability during head movement, which helps identify individuals who may have a deficit of the vestibular system (which regulates internal balance). First, the NIH Toolbox Visual Acuity Test must be administered, followed by the DVA Test. Participants are again seated 12.5 feet from a computer monitor at eye level. For the DVA Test, participants wear lightweight headgear that contains a rate sensor and are asked to move the head back and forth, as if indicating “no.” Once the head is measured to be moving at greater than 180 degrees per second by the rate sensor, an optotype flashes on the monitor, and the participant is asked to identify it. As with the Visual Acuity Test, only the letters H, O, T and V are used for ages 3-7, while ages 8+ use the entire letter set. Smaller optotypes are displayed as the participant correctly identifies letters, and larger ones are displayed if the participant cannot correctly identify the letter shown, until the computer has calculated the smallest size that the participant can see with the head moving. This is calculated separately for head rotation leftward and rightward from center (though the participant continues shaking the head both ways), and this performance is compared to the participant’s visual acuity when the head was stationary (the NIH Toolbox Visual Acuity Test score, sometimes referred to as “static” visual acuity in the context of the DVA test). The difference between static and dynamic visual acuity represents the vestibular contribution to gaze stability. DVA scoring, as with visual acuity, is based in LogMAR units]]>	trm_50f38098952cb

976	<![CDATA[Information Sampling Task]]>	task	<![CDATA[The Information Sampling Task (IST) tests impulsivity and decision making. The participant is presented with a 5x5 array of grey boxes on the screen, and two larger coloured panels below these boxes. The participant is instructed that they are playing a game for points, which they can win by making a correct decision about which colour is in the majority under the grey boxes. They must touch the grey boxes one at a time, which open up to reveal one of the two colours shown at the bottom of the screen. Once a box has been touched, it remains open. When the participant has made their decision about which colour is in the majority, they must touch the panel of that colour at the bottom of the screen to indicate their choice. After the participant has indicated their choice, all the remaining grey boxes on the screen reveal their colours and a message is displayed to inform the participant whether or not they were correct. The colours change from trial to trial. At the end of a trial the grey boxes are displayed on the screen again at a speed which depends on how fast the trial was completed, so that there is always at least 30 seconds between trials. There are two conditions – the fixed win condition, in which the subject is awarded 100 points for a correct decision regardless of the number of boxes opened, and the decreasing win condition, in which the number of points that can be won for a correct decision starts at 250 and decreases by 10 points for every box touched. In either condition, an incorrect decision costs 100 points.]]>	trm_50f73d557c967
977	<![CDATA[Graded Naming Test]]>	task	<![CDATA[The Graded Naming Test, developed by Professor Elizabeth Warrington and Dr Pat McKenna in 1980 , has been used extensively in cognitive neuropsychology. The Graded Naming Test (GNT) avoids the problem of ceiling effects in previous naming tests by having subjects name drawings of objects in ascending difficulty. Reduced efficiency in retrieving the name of an object can be the first and only indication of impaired language functioning. This test assesses object-naming ability, but is in addition graded in difficulty to allow for individual differences. This means that it may be able to detect any word-finding difficulty even in those with an extensive naming vocabulary. Currently available in UK English only (this test is culturally biased and there are no alternative versions at present).]]>	trm_50f741a965470
978	<![CDATA[One Touch Stockings of Cambridge]]>	task	<![CDATA[One Touch Stockings of Cambridge is a spatial planning task which gives a measure of frontal lobe function. OTS is a variant of the Stockings of Cambridge task and places greater demands on working memory as the participant has to visualise the solution. As for SOC (Stockings of Cambridge), the participant is shown two displays containing three coloured balls. The displays are presented in such a way that they can easily be perceived as stacks of coloured balls held in stockings or socks suspended from a beam. This arrangement makes the 3-D concepts involved apparent to the participant, and fits with the verbal instructions. There is a row of numbered boxes along the bottom of the screen. The test administrator first demonstrates to the participant how to use the balls in the lower display to copy the pattern in the upper display, and completes one demonstration problem, where the solution requires one move. The participant must then complete three further problems, one each of 2 moves, 3 moves and 4 moves. Next the participant is shown further problems, and must work out in their head how many moves the solutions to these problems require, then touch the appropriate box at the bottom of the screen to indicate their response.]]>	trm_50f84bbdcfa4e
980	<![CDATA[Rapid Visual Information Processing]]>	task	<![CDATA[Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) is a test of sustained attention (similar to the Continuous Performance Task) and has proved useful in many studies in which drugs are used to help develop a disease model.. It is sensitive to dysfunction in the parietal and frontal lobe areas of the brain and is also a sensitive measure of general performance. A white box appears in the centre of the computer screen, inside which digits, from 2 to 9, appear in a pseudo-random order, at the rate of 100 digits per minute. Participants are requested to detect target sequences of digits (for example, 2-4-6, 3-5-7, 4-6-8) and to register responses using the press pad.]]>	trm_50f8516279419
981	<![CDATA[Match to Sample Visual Search]]>	task	<![CDATA[Match to Sample Visual Search (MTS) is a matching test, with a speed/accuracy trade-off. It is a simultaneous visual search task with response latency dissociated from movement time. Efficient performance on this task requires the ability to search among the targets and ignore the distractor patterns which have elements in common with the target. This test can help to differentiate between Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, and also between Lewy Body dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The participant is shown a complex visual pattern (the sample) in the middle of the screen, and then, after a brief delay, a varying number of similar patterns is shown in a circle of boxes around the edge of the screen. Only one of these boxes matches the pattern in the centre of the screen, and the participant must indicate which it is by touching it. Reaction time is measured on the basis of the release of the press-pad, which allows for its more accurate measurement.]]>	trm_50f852c084fde

The participant's task is to indicate whether each stimulus is old or new. Responses in recognition memory tests are commonly sorted into four classes: Hits ("old" response to an old stimulus), Misses ("new" response to an old stimulus), False Alarms ("old" response to a new stimulus), and Correct Rejections ("new" response to a new stimulus). By comparing the percentage of responses that fall into each of these classes, the experimenter can assess both a participant's ability to discriminate between old and new stimuli, and his or her tendency to provide a particular response regardless of the type of stimulus presented. In many recognition memory tests, each old/new judgment is followed by a prompt asking participants to indicate either how confident they are in that old/new judgment, or what type of subjective experience was elicited by the stimulus being judged (e.g., was the old/new judgment accompanied by a vivid recollection of the encoding experience). This additional information can be used to generate and test more precise hypotheses about how recognition memory decisions are made. Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM) is a specific recognition memory test included in the CANTAB. The participant is presented with a series of 12 visual patterns, one at a time, in the centre of the screen. These patterns are designed so that they cannot easily be given verbal labels. In the recognition phase, the participant is required to choose between a pattern they have already seen and a novel pattern. In this phase, the test patterns are presented in the reverse order to the original order of presentation. This is then repeated, with 12 new patterns. The second recognition phase can be given either immediately or after a 20 minute delay.]]>	tsk_4a57abb949d40

1057	<![CDATA[Risky gains task]]>	task	<![CDATA[Subjects are presented with a sequence of three numbers in ascending order (20, 40, and 80).  Each number is displayed onscreen for one second and, if the subject presses a button while that number is displayed, he/she receives that number of points along with immediate positive visual and auditory feedback.  When a 40 or 80 appears, however, there is a chance that it will appear in an alternate color, along with immediate negative feedback signaling a loss of 40 or 80 points, respectively.  When this occurs, the trial ends immediately (i.e. the subject may not make a response).]]>	tsk_4a57abb949d5b

The advantages of SPECT are that it can be used to observe biochemical and physiological processes as well as size and volume of the organ. The disadvantage is that, unlike positron-emission tomography where the positron-electron annihilation results in the emission of 2 photons at 180 degrees from each other, SPECT requires physical collimation to line up the photons, which results in the loss of many available photons and hence degrades the image.]]>	Empty
